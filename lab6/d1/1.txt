Plot Twist: In the final episode, Kaito and his companions manage to confront The Dark Lord and expose his lies about being a god. As they defeat him, they discover that he has been using a powerful artifact to siphon the life force of the giant creatures to maintain his control over them. With The Dark Lord defeated, the creatures begin to regain their strength and freedom, and the world starts to heal. However, this victory comes at a cost: Kaito sacrifices himself to destroy the artifact, permanently severing The Dark Lord's connection to the creatures and the world. As he dies, Aria and Zach are left to continue his work, guiding the giant creatures and the people who live alongside them into a new era of peace and prosperity.
